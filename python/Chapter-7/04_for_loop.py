# A for loop iterates over the elements of a sequence (or any iterable).

s = "Krishnma"

for i in s:
    print(i)





# Iterating through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry


# Using range() in for Loops:
# The range() function generates a sequence of numbers.

# Printing numbers from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Printing numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

# Printing numbers from 1 to 10, with a step of 2
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)
