'''
Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a 
condition or iterate over elements in a collection like lists, tuples, or strings. 

Python supports two main types of loops:

for loop: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string, dictionary, etc.).
while loop: Repeats as long as a given condition is True
